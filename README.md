# CATIA-PROJECT
Chassis Design Project
Designed using CATIA V5

Developed a detailed 3D model of a vehicle chassis including frame, wheels, and bumper assembly.
Utilized CATIA V5 for modeling, assembly, and detailing of mechanical components.
Focused on structural integrity, weight optimization, and efficient material use.
Ensured that the design met the required manufacturing standards and load-bearing requirements.
